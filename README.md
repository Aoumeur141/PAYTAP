## PyTAP: Your Python Toolkit for Automated Processes 

**What is PyTAP?** 
PyTAP (which stands for 'Python Toolkit for Automated Processes') is a Python package designed to make your coding life easier when you're building automated scripts or applications.Think of it as a 
**toolbox** filled with common, repetitive functions that you often need in various projects. Instead of writing the same code over and over again, you can just grab a tool from PyTAP.  

**What does it do?**  Its main goal is to **consolidate and encapsulate common, repetitive functions**. This means it gathers frequently used code snippets into organized, easy-to-use functions. This makes your projects more efficient, consistent, and quicker to develop.
